\section{Summary}

I am a \textbf{Postdoctoral Researcher} at Polytechnique Montréal, affiliated to the MAGI Department and the Scale-AI Chair held by Professor Thibaut Vidal.
I have completed a PhD at INRIA and INSA Rennes under the supervision of Cédric Herzet, Clément Elvira and Ayşe-Nur Arslan.
My research mainly focuses on \textbf{mixed-integer and convex optimization problems} related to Machine Learning and Signal Processing applications.
My PhD was related to Branch-and-Bound algorithms development of efficient algorithms to address $\ell_0$-norm problems and my Postdoc is concentrates on interplays between Operation Research and Machine Learning.
